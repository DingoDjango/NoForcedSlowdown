Removes the forced x1 speed multiplier which triggers on some events.

RimWorld automatically slows down gameplay speed to x1 when certain events fire. The game also prevents you from going back to a higher speed for a considerable amount of time.

This mod aims to fix that by preventing this mechanic from triggering.
